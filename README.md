# GradeCalculatorApp

## Grade Calculator and Summary

### What will the application do?

This application will calculate what percentage you will need to score on the final exam to get your desired final grade in a course, calculate your average, and keep track of your marks and their corresponding categories for a given course.

### Who will use it?
This application is for students who would like to keep track of their classes and grades and utilize a grade calculator that also saves the categories and weights of their courses. This app can help students save time retyping, editing, and viewing their marks each time they want to utilize an online grade calculator while checking their overall average within the same application.

### Why is this project of interest to you?
As a student, I constantly check my grades and calculate what I need to score on my final to receive my desired grade. Because these websites never save data on previously entered marks and weights of a course, using an online grade calculator can be tedious. Given that I frequently use this website while using the UBC grades summary function, I see myself using this application with more functions, simplicity, and convenience.
